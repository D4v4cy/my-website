            <h2 class="text-green">Blog #001: Steganography – The Art of Hiding in Plain Sight</h2>
            <p class="text-white"><em>(By the time you finish reading this, you'll start questioning everything you've ever downloaded.)</em></p>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-white">There's a difference between <strong>invisible</strong> and <strong>overlooked</strong>. The former is a fantasy. The latter is a flaw in human nature.</p>
            <p class="text-white">Most people think secrecy is about <strong>locking things away</strong>—strong passwords, encrypted files, VPNs stacked on top of VPNs. But real secrecy? <strong>It's about hiding where no one thinks to look.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">That's where <strong>steganography</strong> comes in.</p>
            <p class="text-white">A message hidden inside an image. A payload tucked into an audio file. A blueprint disguised as white noise. <strong>Your eyes don't see it. Your ears don't hear it. But it's there.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">And if you don't know how to find it, <strong>maybe you were never meant to.</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-blue">The Basics: What They Don't Teach You in School</h3>
            <p class="text-white">Steganography isn't new. People have been <strong>smuggling secrets past prying eyes for centuries</strong>—inking messages between the lines of old books, using invisible ink on blank pages, embedding war strategies inside innocent letters.</p>
            <p class="text-white">But <strong>this isn't the 1700s.</strong> The battlefield has changed. Now, secrets travel through <strong>pixels, soundwaves, and metadata.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">It works like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-white">🕶️ Take an image—your average, harmless-looking selfie.</li>
                <li class="text-white">🕶️ Modify its pixel values, just enough to inject a message but <strong>not enough for the human eye to notice.</strong></li>
                <li class="text-white">🕶️ Send it. Post it. Let it live in plain sight.</li>
                <li class="text-white">🕶️ Someone with the right tools extracts the message.</li>
                <li class="text-white">🕶️ The rest of the world? <strong>They scroll past, completely unaware.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-white"><strong>Hiding a message isn't hard.</strong> Making sure it never gets found? <strong>That's an art.</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-blue">Where It Gets Fun (Or Dangerous, Depending on Who You Are)</h3>
            <p class="text-white">Most people think of steganography as a <strong>spy tactic</strong>—Cold War secrecy, espionage, governments passing intel through pixels. Cute.</p>
            <p class="text-white">But let's be real. <strong>It's everywhere.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-white">🔹 <strong>Hacked websites hide payloads inside innocent-looking PNGs.</strong></li>
                <li class="text-white">🔹 <strong>Malware uses audio files to smuggle in second-stage exploits.</strong></li>
                <li class="text-white">🔹 <strong>Secret communications hide inside shared meme images.</strong></li>
                <li class="text-white">🔹 <strong>Keyloggers disguised inside music files you never should've downloaded.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-white">It's not just about hiding messages. <strong>It's about deception. Camouflage. A trick played on human perception.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">And the best part? <strong>You've already encountered it.</strong> You just didn't know.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-blue">How to Start Seeing the Unseen</h3>
            <p class="text-white"><strong>Think every file is lying to you.</strong> That's step one.</p>
            <p class="text-white">Step two? Start digging.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-white">🛠️ <strong>StegHide</strong> – A classic. Extracts hidden data from image and audio files.</li>
                <li class="text-white">🛠️ <strong>StegSolve</strong> – Plays with image layers, exposing what was meant to stay buried.</li>
                <li class="text-white">🛠️ <strong>zsteg</strong> – Brutal. No PNG is safe.</li>
                <li class="text-white">🛠️ <strong>Audacity</strong> – Not just for music. Load an audio file, check the spectrogram. <strong>See anything weird? You should.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-white">Want to know if that cute cat picture <strong>actually contains a payload</strong>? These are your tools.</p>
            <p class="text-white">Or maybe you'd rather <strong>be the one hiding things.</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-blue">The Takeaway: Nothing Is Ever Just One Thing</h3>
            <p class="text-white">That picture? <strong>Not just a picture.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">That song? <strong>Not just a song.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">That innocent little PDF? <strong>Not so innocent.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">Once you see it, <strong>you can't unsee it.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">The internet is <strong>full of secrets.</strong> Some are meant to be found. <strong>Others are meant to stay buried.</strong></p>
