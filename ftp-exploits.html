            <p class="text-white"><em>(or: How to Leave Your Front Door Open and Act Surprised When Someone Walks In.)</em></p>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-white">If there's one thing you should know about <strong>FTP</strong>, it's this:</p>
            <p class="text-white"><strong>It was never meant to be secure.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">Back in the 1970s, when the internet was a <strong>small, friendly neighborhood</strong>, people thought,<br>
            <em>"Hey, let's share files. No need for locks. We trust each other, right?"</em></p>
            <p class="text-white">Fast forward to today, and <strong>FTP is still here</strong>â€”limping along, riddled with holes, clinging to its outdated protocols like an antique safe made of glass. And yet, companies still use it. Servers still run it.</p>
            <p class="text-white">And <strong>people still believe</strong> it's keeping their data safe.</p>
            <p class="text-white"><strong>That's what makes this so funny.</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-blue">The Illusion of Security</h3>
            <p class="text-white">FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is <strong>old-school</strong>â€”it moves files between computers, nothing fancy. But when security is <strong>based on the hope that no one will look too closely</strong>, you already know where this is going.</p>
            <p class="text-white">Here's how FTP "security" works in the wild:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Anonymous Access Enabled?</strong> Congratulations, your server is a public library now.</li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Default Credentials?</strong> Well, if "admin:admin" worked last timeâ€¦</li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Plaintext Passwords?</strong> Hope you enjoy sending your login info in <strong>clear text</strong> for the whole internet to see.</li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Unpatched Servers?</strong> Nothing says "exploit me" like an outdated version still running from the 90s.</li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Guessable Directory Structures?</strong> */backup*, */admin*, */super-secret-don't-open*â€¦ Seriously?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-white">It's <strong>not even hacking</strong> at this point. It's <strong>walking in through an open door.</strong></p>

            <h3 class="text-blue">How to Break FTP (A Comedy in Three Acts)</h3>
            <h4 class="text-green">Act 1: Finding the Target</h4>
            <p class="text-white">Ever heard of <strong>Shodan</strong>? It's like Google, but instead of finding cat videos, it finds <strong>exposed FTP servers</strong>.<br>
            Try:</p>
            <pre class="text-white" style="background-color: #1e1e1e; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;">
ftp port:21
            </pre>
            <p class="text-white">Or if you're feeling lucky:</p>
            <pre class="text-white" style="background-color: #1e1e1e; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;">
"230 Login successful" port:21
            </pre>
            <p class="text-white">Now, look at all those <strong>friendly, welcoming</strong> FTP servers just waiting to be explored.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4 class="text-green">Act 2: Guessing the Keys</h4>
            <p class="text-white">You'd think, by now, <strong>people would stop using default credentials.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">You'd be wrong.</p>
            <p class="text-white">Try the classics:</p>
            <pre class="text-white" style="background-color: #1e1e1e; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;">
admin:admin
root:root
ftp:ftp
user:password
            </pre>
            <p class="text-white">And if that doesn't work? <strong>Brute force is your friend.</strong><br>
            Tools like <strong>Hydra</strong> or <strong>Medusa</strong> can take a dictionary of passwords andâ€¦ well, let's just say "access denied" doesn't last forever.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4 class="text-green">Act 3: The Hidden Treasures</h4>
            <p class="text-white">Once inside, what do we find?</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ“‚ <strong>Confidential PDFs</strong> (because encrypting sensitive files is apparently too much effort)</li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ“‚ <strong>Private keys</strong> (you'd be amazed where people store these)</li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ“‚ <strong>Entire database backups</strong> (whoops.)</li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ“‚ <strong>Someone's music collection</strong> (you like '80s synthwave, Jim from Accounting? Good taste.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-white">And sometimes, if you dig deep enoughâ€¦<br>
            ðŸ“‚ <strong>A .txt file that just says "please don't hack me."</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">Too late, Jim.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-blue">But Wait, There's More!</h3>
            <p class="text-white">If plain old <strong>stealing files</strong> isn't your thing, why not <strong>turn the server into your playground?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Upload your own backdoor</strong> â€“ Because who doesn't love <strong>persistent access?</strong></li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Modify files</strong> â€“ Who needs ransomware when you can just <strong>swap out important documents for memes?</strong></li>
                <li class="text-white">ðŸ”¹ <strong>Pivot deeper</strong> â€“ An FTP server is often <strong>just one step away from something juicier.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-white">The best part? <strong>Most of the time, no one even notices.</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-blue">The Takeaway: You Left the Door Open. I Just Walked In.</h3>
            <p class="text-white">Security through obscurity <strong>is not security.</strong> It's hope. And hope is <strong>not an access control system.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">If your <strong>FTP server is exposed</strong>, don't act surprised when someone <strong>steps inside, takes a look around, and maybe rearranges your furniture.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-white">And if you're one of the people still <strong>trusting FTP in 2025</strong>, let me just say this:</p>
