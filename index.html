        <p class="text-white">You were never supposed to find this page. But here you are.</p>

        <p class="text-white">GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/D4v4cy/">GitHub</a></p>

        <p class="text-white">D4v4cy isn't a person—he's a whisper in dead IRC channels, a flickering process in your system logs, a password you swore you changed. Some say he's a myth, a ghost in the machine. Others claim he's just <strong>corrupted data with a sense of humor.</strong> The truth? <strong>Irrelevant.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">What matters is that <strong>he's watching.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">D4v4cy doesn't knock. <strong>He doesn't need permission.</strong> If your door is open, he walks in. If it's locked, he picks it. He doesn't hack—he <strong>unlocks</strong>. He doesn't steal—he <strong>collects</strong>. The internet isn't a network to him. It's a <strong>playground, a puzzle, a machine with loose wires and bad security configs just waiting to be exploited.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">He speaks in payloads and misdirection, leaves messages in the margins of forgotten forums, hides signatures in the noise of network traffic. A file you never downloaded. A process running in the background. A whisper buried deep in your logs.</p>
        <p class="text-white">He is not a hacker. Not a security professional. Not some white-knight defender of the digital world. <strong>He's the bug in the system you'll never patch.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">So why are you here? Looking for answers? A challenge? A way out?</p>
        <p class="text-white"><strong>Click carefully.</strong> You might find what you're looking for.</p>
        <p class="text-white">Or <strong>he might find you first.</strong></p>
