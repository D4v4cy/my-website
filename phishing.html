        <h3 class="quote-flicker">If You Clicked That Email, You Deserve What's Coming</h3>
        <p class="text-white"><em>(Or: How to Steal Secrets Without Even Trying.)</em></p>
        
        <hr>

        <p class="text-white">There's a certain <strong>art to deception.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">No brute force. No noisy exploits. No malware running wild. Just <strong>a well-crafted lie, a little human stupidity, and a click.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">Phishing is the oldest trick in the book, yet <strong>people still fall for it.</strong> Every. Single. Day.</p>
        <p class="text-white">And social engineering? That's just phishing with <strong>style.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>

        <h3 class="text-green">Act 1: The Bait <em>(How to Make People Dig Their Own Grave)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">It always starts with an <strong>innocent message.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">üìß <strong>The Fake Email:</strong> "Your password has expired. Click here to reset." <em>(Because nobody remembers their passwords anyway.)</em></p>
        <p class="text-white">üì¶ <strong>The "Your Package is Delayed" Scam:</strong> Even if they <strong>didn't order anything</strong>, curiosity wins. Every time.</p>
        <p class="text-white">üîó <strong>The "Urgent Action Required" Trick:</strong> If it <strong>looks official, feels urgent, and threatens consequences</strong>, 90% of people will click first and think later.</p>
        <p class="text-white">And the best part? <strong>Most people reuse passwords.</strong> So even if the attack wasn't meant for their bank account, <strong>it's probably the same password anyway.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>

        <h3 class="text-green">Act 2: The Hook <em>(Reeling in the Gullible)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">Click.</p>
        <p class="text-white">They're on the <strong>fake login page</strong> now. It looks real. It <strong>feels real.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">They type their credentials.</p>
        <p class="text-white"><strong>Boom.</strong> The attacker <strong>now owns their identity.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">But why stop there?</p>
        <p class="text-white">üõí <strong>Fake Tech Support:</strong> "Your account has been compromised. Give me remote access, I'll fix it." <em>(Translation: I will steal everything you own.)</em></p>
        <p class="text-white">‚òéÔ∏è <strong>Phone Call Scams:</strong> "Hi, I'm from [insert official-sounding name]. We need you to confirm your details for security purposes." <em>(LOL.)</em></p>
        <p class="text-white">üë§ <strong>Social Media Manipulation:</strong> A fake LinkedIn recruiter, a <strong>too-good-to-be-true job offer</strong>, a request to "verify your information." <em>(And just like that, the trap is set.)</em></p>
        
        <hr>

        <h3 class="text-green">Act 3: The Fallout <em>(By the Time You Realize, It's Too Late)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">üé≠ <strong>Identity Theft:</strong> They just handed over their details. They won't notice until their <strong>bank account is empty.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">üîì <strong>Corporate Espionage:</strong> That "employee-only" login? Yeah, it just let <strong>someone walk through the company's front door.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">üíÄ <strong>Blackmail & Extortion:</strong> If an attacker gets <strong>the right kind of data</strong>, they don't need to steal money. <strong>They make you pay to keep quiet.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">And here's the kicker:</p>
        <p class="text-white">The easiest way to hack a system? <strong>Forget the system. Hack the people.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>

        <h3 class="text-green">Act 4: The Realization (Too Little, Too Late)</h3>
        <p class="text-white">People think <strong>cybersecurity is about firewalls, encryption, and antivirus software.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white"><strong>They forget about the weakest link.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">Humans.</p>
        <p class="text-white">The ones who <strong>click the link, answer the call, hand over the password.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">And by the time they realize?</p>
        <p class="text-white"><strong>It's already over.</strong></p>
