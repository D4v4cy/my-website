        <h2 class="text-green">Unconventional Skillset: What Can I Do? <em>(More than you're ready for.)</em></h2>
        <p class="text-white">Some people build. Some people destroy. <strong>D4v4cy does both.</strong> He doesn't just break thingsâ€”<strong>he makes them beg.</strong> Every system has a flaw, every lock has a weakness, and every human has a point where they give in. <strong>It's just a matter of time.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="text-blue">Reverse Engineering <em>(If you made it, I can unmake it.)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">Software, hardware, networksâ€”<strong>everything can be unraveled.</strong> The difference between a creator and a cracker? <strong>One follows the manual. The other rewrites it.</strong></p>
        
        <h3 class="text-blue">Steganography & Hidden Data Channels <em>(Some secrets deserve to stay buried. Others deserve to be found.)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">A picture is worth a thousand words. <strong>Some of them you weren't meant to read.</strong> Messages where you'd never expect, smuggled inside pixels, audio waves, random bits of noise. <strong>Invisible to you. Until it's not.</strong></p>
        
        <h3 class="text-blue">Signal Interception & Network Manipulation <em>(Who said you were the only one listening?)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">Traffic flows like a river. <strong>D4v4cy builds the dam, redirects the current, poisons the well.</strong> If your data was private, <strong>why is he holding it?</strong></p>
        
        <h3 class="text-blue">Social Engineering & Psychological Exploits <em>(The strongest system is still weaker than a human with bad instincts.)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">Passwords are hard. <strong>People are easy.</strong> Click the link, answer the call, trust the wrong person. <strong>Oops.</strong></p>
        
        <h3 class="text-blue">Exploit Development & Cracking <em>(Some doors open with keys. Others with force.)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">Weak encryption. Lazy developers. Forgotten vulnerabilities. <strong>Everything has a way in.</strong> Some people knockâ€”<strong>D4v4cy doesn't.</strong></p>
        
        <h3 class="text-blue">Obfuscation, Anonymity & The Art of Disappearing <em>(You never saw me. But I saw you.)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">The best way to hide? <strong>Never exist in the first place.</strong> Burn the logs, bury the trails, corrupt the timestamps. <strong>Vanishing is an art. And D4v4cy is the artist.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="text-green">Tools of the Trade <em>(Or toys, if we're being honest.)</em></h2>
