        <h3 class="text-blue">(Or: How to Turn Someone's Life into a Paywall.)</h3>
        <hr>
        
        <p class="text-white">There are <strong>two types</strong> of people in this world.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="text-white"><strong>The ones who back up their data.</strong></li>
            <li class="text-white"><strong>The ones who pay for their mistakes.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-white">Guess which ones are more fun?</p>
        <p class="text-white">Ransomware is <strong>the modern-day digital heist</strong>—except instead of kicking down doors, you just <strong>lock people out of their own world</strong>. No alarms, no messy getaways. Just an anonymous message on their screen, a demand, and the sound of their heartbeat <strong>as the seconds tick away.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">Now, for "educational" purposes, let's talk about how this works.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 class="text-green">Act 1: The Infiltration <em>(Getting In Without Knocking)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">A ransomware attack starts with a simple premise: <strong>get inside, stay hidden, then ruin their day.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">🚪 <strong>Phishing Emails:</strong> A fake invoice. A "security alert" from their bank. A "free gift card" (because humans are predictable). One click, and… welcome home.</p>
        <p class="text-white">🕵️ <strong>Exploiting RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):</strong> Because leaving an <strong>RDP port open</strong> is basically taping your house key to the front door. Brute force a weak password, and you're in.</p>
        <p class="text-white">📦 <strong>Trojanized Software:</strong> That "cracked" version of Photoshop they downloaded? Yeah, let's just say it came with <em>extras</em>.</p>
        <p class="text-white">🖥️ <strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Why target one person when you can <strong>compromise a trusted software update</strong> and get thousands? Efficiency is key.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 class="text-green">Act 2: The Execution <em>(Time to Flip the Switch)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">Now that we're inside, it's time to get cozy. <strong>No sudden movements. No alarms.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">🔍 <strong>Lurking in the Shadows:</strong> The best ransomware doesn't attack immediately. It <strong>spreads quietly</strong>, crawling through networks, looking for backups, sniffing out valuable files.</p>
        <p class="text-white">🔑 <strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Because why settle for one machine when you can own <strong>an entire system</strong>?</p>
        <p class="text-white">💣 <strong>The Payload Drop:</strong> When everything is in place, the encryption begins. <strong>No files spared. No mercy.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">And then comes <strong>the message</strong>:</p>
        <p class="quote-flicker">"We have your files. We have your life. Pay up, or lose it all."</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 class="text-green">Act 3: The Negotiation <em>(Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.)</em></h3>
        <p class="text-white">💰 <strong>The Demand:</strong> Pay in <strong>Bitcoin, Monero, or whatever's untraceable</strong>. The countdown begins.</p>
        <p class="text-white">📉 <strong>The Panic:</strong> They try <strong>to restore from backups</strong>, only to realize… those backups? Yeah, they're gone too.</p>
        <p class="text-white">🚨 <strong>The Fake "Decryption Tools":</strong> Some ransomware gangs <strong>offer fake fixes</strong>—because why extort once when you can <strong>extort twice</strong>?</p>
        <p class="text-white">⏳ <strong>The Deadline:</strong> Pay or perish. And if they don't? <strong>Well, hope they didn't have anything important.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 class="text-green">Bonus Round: The Evolution of Ransomware</h3>
        <p class="text-white">The old days of simple file encryption? <strong>Child's play.</strong> Now, we have:</p>
        <p class="text-white">🔹 <strong>Double Extortion:</strong> Encrypt the files AND threaten to leak them. Because <strong>fear sells.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">🔹 <strong>Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS):</strong> You don't even have to be a tech genius. Just rent a <strong>ransomware kit</strong>, and congratulations—you're now a cybercriminal.</p>
        <p class="text-white">🔹 <strong>Automated Worms:</strong> WannaCry, anyone? <strong>Self-spreading ransomware. No human input needed.</strong></p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 class="text-green">The Inevitable Truth</h3>
        <p class="text-white">Some victims <strong>pay.</strong> Some refuse. Some <strong>burn everything down and start over.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">And ransomware? It <strong>keeps evolving.</strong></p>
        <p class="text-white">Because as long as people <strong>click suspicious links, use weak passwords, and believe "it won't happen to me"</strong>—</p>
        <p class="text-white">It will.</p>
